# Bike Commute Overview
This is the Apple Numbers template that I use to track my bike commute rides. As I was often asked on Twitter and Facebook to share it, well, here it is.

## Dependencies
* Apple Numbers (the template works with version 6.2.1)

## How to use the template
The template contains three sheets named Bike2Work, Settings and Analysis.

Let's have a look at the Settings sheet first:
### Sheet: Settings
This sheet enables you to configure the template to your own needs.

#### Date settings
**Year**

Change this value to recalculate all dates in the Bike2Work sheet.

**Saturday/Sunday**

In order to highlight the weekends in the Bike2Work sheet the template must know about the 2 days you consider as weekend days.

#### Work and non-working days settings

Here you can configure several abbreviations for work and non-working days. Work days will be coloured green in the template, non-working days will be highlighted in red.

Please note: Currently home office days and non-working days won't calculate public transport costs.

#### Units for calculations

Change the values for public transport costs and CO2 savings to your reuqirements.

### Sheet: Bike2Work

This is the main sheet of the template containing 12 tables, each for every month of the configured year (see the Settings sheet).

#### Entering values
Each of the 12 tables contains 1 row per day where you can enter the values for your bike commute rides. The template assumes that you have a maximum of 2 bike commute rides per day: One outward journey and one return journey.

To help the template with the various calculations you first have to enter in column P the kind of day you experienced. You can configure this abbreviations in the Settings sheet.

Afterwards you can enter the distance, duration, weather conditions etc.

In column AG you can also specify money spent on food on this day. And column AH can help you track costs spent on bicycle equipment/repairs.

The Notes named column AI can be used as a diary and to remember interesting things.

### Sheet: Analysis

This sheet summarizes all the values entered in the Bike2Work sheet on a monthly basis and gives an excellent progress overview. Nothing more, nothing less.

I use this often to brag on Social Media about my amazing bike2work numbers.
